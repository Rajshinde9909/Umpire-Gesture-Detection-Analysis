# Umpire Hand Gesture Detection and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and analyzing umpire hand gestures during sports events using camera footage. By employing computer vision techniques, we aim to recognize specific hand gestures made by umpires, translate these gestures into meaningful signals or decisions, and visualize the data using line graphs to identify trends, frequency, and patterns.

## Features

- **Real-time Gesture Detection**: Capture and process video footage to detect umpire hand gestures.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Identify specific gestures and translate them into corresponding signals or decisions.
- **Data Logging**: Record recognized gestures for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generate line graphs to visualize trends, frequency, and patterns of umpire gestures over time.
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze the accuracy and consistency of umpire decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for development and testing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/umpire-gesture-detection.git
   cd umpire-gesture-detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Capture video footage of umpire hand gestures using a camera. Save the footage in a directory.

2. **Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to extract frames and prepare the dataset.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input_dir path_to_videos --output_dir path_to_processed_data
   ```

3. **Model Training**: Train the gesture recognition model using the prepared dataset.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data_dir path_to_processed_data --output_model path_to_save_model
   ```

4. **Real-time Detection**: Use the trained model to detect and recognize umpire gestures in real-time.
   ```bash
   python real_time_detection.py --model path_to_saved_model --video_source camera_or_video_path
   ```

5. **Data Logging and Analysis**: Log recognized gestures and analyze the data to generate line graphs.
   ```bash
   python analyze_gestures.py --log_dir path_to_log_files --output_dir path_to_save_analysis
   ```
